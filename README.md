# Spreadsheet Validator UI

Spreadsheet Validator is a web tool used to validate and repair metadata that are bundled in an Excel spreadsheet. The validator checks the metadata record against a [CEDAR](https://cedar.metadatacenter.org/) template specification, which is a machine-readable metadata specification, to find discrepancies and input errors. This repository stores the user interface module of the application.
